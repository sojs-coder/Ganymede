# Ganymede
A long time ago, on a moon kind of far away, lived 5 intelligent species. Each of these species had a gem that they guarded with their lives. Humans guarded amethyst, dragons guarded amber, dwarves guarded obsidian, goblins ammolite, and trolls emerald. The five lived in peace for hundreds of years, until the humans got greedy.

Two humans gathered a large following, and set out to conquer the gems for themselves. They failed, but tensions between the five have risen dramatically since then.

Humans, greedy as they are, have continued the quest to conquer the gems. You are plunged into the middle of this conflict, destined to become the richest person on the moon by predicting the gem markets and bartering your way to incredibly rare items.

Good luck.
